- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org)

## Libraries used

- Spring Boot 2.3.8.RELEASE
- Eureka Server
- Config Client

- Spring Boot Actuator

## Installing the libraries

You can use the following command to install the necessary libraries

```shell
mvn install
```

## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `com.stackroute.eureka` class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```
